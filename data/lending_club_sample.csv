I accumulated credit card debt while in college and with recent health emergencies($3400 on card, $1300 on another). Interest rates are currently around 23%. I'm a bit old fashioned and I believe in living a debt-free life (or as close to one as possible) so I'd like to consolidate these, get a better rate, and cancel the cards for good. I am just starting my career, I just bought my first home, and I hope I can start my life off on the right foot. Well, that's my sob story!

Experian rating of 714. I have had the same job for eight and a half years. HSBC raised my interest rate on a credit card from 13% to 25% a few months ago, for no reason (greed?). In the past I would have cashed in some stocks to pay for this, but this year it would just lock in my losses.  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have never missed a payment on any debt, ever.  I pay several times the minimum on all credit cards. I have paid off one credit card in the past year and will pay off three more (the closed cards) by the end of this year. My credit score is less than excellent simply because I concentrate on paying off closed cards first--for example I have balances of $1,250 (Bank of America at 9.5%), $2,450 (Wachovia at 8%), and $1,400 (American Express at 11.25%) on closed accounts. I also have a home equity loan for $15,000 at 4.5%. Open credit cards are at low rates of interest (except for my friends at HSBC!): Wachovia 11% on $900, FIA, 9.9% on 7,900 and 2.9% on 2,500; Discover, 5.9% on $1,000, 11.24% on 1,000, and almost $1,000 at no interest; National City, 13% on 10,000, and a 13% loan from Prosper for $5500. Experian lists a card which I paid off and closed 10 years ago as open--I have asked them to correct this.

I believe it would be higher if I had a longer credit history. I am financially responsible, hold a steady income, and own my home. In the last seven months of employment since graduation, I have paid off over $6000 in student loan and credit card debt. <br/><br/>About the Loan:<br/><br/>I have been paying Sallie Mae faithfully every month for two years now and only $700 has come off the principal on my student loan of $5000. They estimate that I have another 7 years left to pay it off at their 11.8% interest rate. I would much rather have it paid off in 3 years, while paying off my credit cards as well. <br/><br/>I have four credit cards, two of which are fully paid off. They have a total limit of over $30,000. I have $6500 charged to two of them leftover from when I was in college. Both have the same high interest rates they had when I got them during school (one is around 15% and the other is about 18%).<br/><br/>With this loan, I intend to pay off the Sallie Mae remainder ($4300) and these cards ($6500) in one convenient monthly payment. Any money left over after fees will go into my savings account for emergencies.<br/> Borrower added on 11/15/10 > My Employment:<br/><br/>I am securely employed in a 2.5 year contract.

The amount I am paying per month (200.00) for this credit card is the same amount as this loan. The only difference is I can pay this high interest credit card off and have some extra money to make some major repairs to my home. I'm looking to sell my home and find a ranch layout for my two girls who have juvenile arthritis. <br/><br/>I have been with TVA Fire and Safety for over 6 years. I also plan to go back to school this fall for my bachelorâs degree in Mechanical Engineering. My company will fund my entire school program. I also have a 2nd income. My wife works for a Fertility Clinic and has been for over 3 years. We both have a steady income. <br/><br/>I plan on paying off this loan in 3 years time. I plan to use my tax returns to repay the loan and/or the equity in my home when I sell.   <br/><br/>I have low debt on my other card balances and pay them on time. On my credit report 2 years ago I missed one payment due to a divorce. My wife left and I had to use my credit card at the time to pay for food, bills and mortgage payments. This is the only reason why this card has a high balance of 7000.00.  Since then, I have not missed one payment on any of my cards, utility bills, car payments or mortgage.<br/><br/>Please feel free to ask anymore questions.

I never made a late payment or missed a payment. Now the CC company has jacked up my rates, so even though I am paying the same amount each month as I was before, now it's just the minimum payment. Basically, they said ""if this guy can pay $X every month, let's hike his interest so we get more and he can't pay down principle."" My response - enough is enough. I'd rather smart investors like Lending Club members get my interest money than keep sending it to a credit card company that treats me this way! Please help me free myself from these companies.
